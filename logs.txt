Question: How were Neonatal anthropometric measurements made?
Answer: Neonatal anthropometric measurements were made by trained and certified personnel, including the recording of birthweight and gestational age from medical records. Birth length was measured using an infantometer, while skinfold thicknesses were taken with a Lange skinfold caliper at specific body sites. Measurements were conducted before discharge, and duplicates were obtained to ensure reliability, averaging the closest values if discrepancies occurred.
