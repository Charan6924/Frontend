Question: How were Neonatal anthropometric measurements made?
Answer: Neonatal anthropometric measurements were conducted by trained personnel, including the collection of birthweight and gestational age from medical records. Birth length was measured using an infantometer, while skinfold thickness was assessed using a Lange skinfold caliper at specified body sites. Measurements were taken in duplicate, with a third if needed, and averaged based on precision requirements before discharge, typically 12–24 hours after delivery.
