🧠 FastAPI RAG Backend with PDF Retrieval

This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FastAPI, LangGraph, and OpenAI GPT-4. It supports document-based question answering from PDFs with optional logging via tools.

🚀 Features
- RAG pipeline using OpenAI + In-Memory Vector Store
- PDF ingestion with chunking and embedding
- Smart agent powered by LangGraph and ReAct
- Custom tools for question answering and logging
- FastAPI API with Swagger docs for interaction

🧑‍💻 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repo
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
$ cd your-repo

2. Create Virtual Environment
$ python -m venv fast_env
$ source fast_env/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or use:
$ pip install fastapi uvicorn openai langchain langgraph python-dotenv pypdf sentence-transformers

4. Setup API Keys
Create a `.env` file:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

5. Add PDF Files
Place all your PDF documents in the `Files/` directory.

✅ Run the Server
$ uvicorn main:app --reload

Swagger Docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

📬 Example Query
POST to /rag with:
{
  "query": "What were the neonatal measurement methods?"
}

Response:
{
  "answer": "...",
  "full_trace": [...]
}

🛠 Tools Used
- FastAPI
- LangGraph
- OpenAI GPT-4
- SentenceTransformers
- Uvicorn

🧼 Security Notes
- API key is stored in .env
- .env is gitignored by default — do not commit it!

📌 TODOs / Roadmap
- Add support for file upload via API
- Include document source references
- Deploy on Render or Hugging Face Spaces
- Add user memory/chat history
